DXLParallels
============

DXLParallels is an example implementation for a Rational DOORS DXL parallelization framework. 

A tutorial on the creation of this framework is included. 

Note that it is a Doors DXL library. All examples use relative includes, that means, that the DOORS environment must have the root path of the DXLParallels project in the ADDINS/PROJECTADDINS configuration. 

If your database has DXL security configured you might not be able to run the examples. 

There is a runDOORS.bat file included that might allow you to start DOORS correctly configured. If your DOORS client is installed in a weird location or your default database is not correctly setup, you might need to edit the runDOORS.bat file to start the DOORS client correctly configured.
